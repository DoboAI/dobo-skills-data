Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### API connection to your Spotify account\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, in your [Skill\nsettings for Spotify](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill) in home.mycroft.ai you will see settings for the Spotify Skill. You will see a username and password field and a 'Connect' button. Ignore the username and password field for now, and click the 'Connect' button. You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",

        "description": "Get listings of US National Parks by state, have Mycroft read descriptions of  national parks and even test your knowledge of where National Parks are located.\n\nTo use this skill  you will need to obtain an API key from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).  Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n\nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",

        "description": "This skill adds [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) support to [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai).\nThe skill takes advantage of the openHAB REST API, so it works both with the v1.x and v2.x of openHAB.\n\nIn order to make openHAB Items accessible to Mycroft, they need to be [tagged](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/homekit/).\nDevice names recognized by Mycroft are matched against openHAB Item Labels.\n\nThe above examples would all work with the following set of openHAB Item definitons:\n\n```java\nColor DiningroomLight \"Diningroom Light\" <light> (gKitchen) [ \"Lighting\" ] {channel=\"hue:0200:1:bloom1:color\"}\nColor KitchenLight \"Kitchen Light\" <light> (gKitchen) [ \"Lighting\" ] {channel=\"hue:0200:1:bloom1:color\"}\nSwitch GoodNight \"Good Night\"\t[ \"Switchable\" ]\n\nNumber MqttID1Temperature \"Bedroom Temperature\" <temperature> [ \"CurrentTemperature\" ] {mqtt=\"<[mosquitto:mysensors/SI/1/1/1/0/0:state:default]\"}\nNumber MqttID1Humidity \"Bedroom Humidity\" [ \"CurrentHumidity\" ] {mqtt=\"<[mosquitto:mysensors/SI/1/0/1/0/1:state:default]\"}\n\nGroup gThermostat \"Main Thermostat\" [ \"gMainThermostat\" ]\nNumber MainThermostatCurrentTemp \"Main Thermostat Current Temperature\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"CurrentTemperature\" ]\nNumber MainThermostatTargetTemperature \"Main Thermostat Target Temperature\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"TargetTemperature\" ]\nString MainThermostatHeatingCoolingMode \"Main Thermostat Heating/Cooling Mode\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"homekit:HeatingCoolingMode\" ]\n```\n\nIf items are modified in openHAB, a refresh in Mycroft is needed by the command:\n\n- *\"Hey Mycroft, refresh openhab items\"*\n\nIf you've forgotten what items have been identified, you can ask Mycroft:\n- *\"Hey Mycroft, list openhab items\"*",

Whthin this time, further commands to the cows list will refer to the list and/or task in context.\nFor instance:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find bananas on the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found bananas on list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete it\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read the list\"\n* Mycroft: \"List grocery has 3 tasks on it, potatos, apples, oranges\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges on list grocery was marked complete\"\n\nSome commands support special dialogs. For instance\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add bananas to the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas was added to list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges, anything else?\"\n* You: \"appels\"\n* Mycroft: \"apples, anything else?\"\n* You: \"potatos\"\n* Mycroft: \"potatos, anything else?\"\n* You: \"no\"\n* Mycroft: \"okay, the tasks are added to list grocery\"\n\nThe skill will try to recognize mispronounced list or task names, for example:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find call back on my bin box list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I can't find a list called bin box, do you want to use the list inbox instead?\"\n* You: \"yes\"\n* Mycroft: \"I did not find call back, but i did find call home on list inbox\"\n\n\n#### Commands\nThis section lists all available commands.\n\nIn general, for all operations below, you can substitute \"my\" list with \"the\" list, i.e. \"add milk to the grocery list\" and \"add milk to my grocery list\" are both valid.\n\nBe careful about using the word 'list' when you name the lists in Remember The Milk. For instance, the skill can handle a list called 'grocery' OR a list called 'grocery list', but if you have BOTH, the skill will only find the 'grocery list'.\n\n#### Add a task\nFor example:\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add milk to my grocery list\"\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home to list Inbox\"\n\nThe skill is using Remember The Milk [\"smart add\"](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=basics.smartadd.whatis.) For example:\n\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home tomorrow at 9 to list Inbox\"\n\nwill add a task called \"remember to call home\" to the Remember The Milk's Inbox, and set the due date to tomorrow at 9. See also the due command later in this section.\n\n#### Complete task\nComplete a task on a list, the operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete call home on my personal list\"\n* Mycroft: \"Call home on list personal was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored call home on list personal again\"\n\n#### Complete all tasks on a list\nComplete all tasks on a list, this operation may take a while if there are many tasks. The operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete all tasks on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"3 tasks on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored 3 tasks on list grocery again\"\n\nTo keep processing time down, a maximum of 40 tasks can be deleted for each complete list command. The\nRTM api has a rate limit of 1 call per second, 40 tasks will take approximately 40 seconds to complete.\nIf you use the Mycroft \"stop\" command during processing, it may not be possible to undo the operation.\n\n#### Due tasks\nFind out what tasks are due. Due date can be one of: \"now, yesterday, today, tomorrow, monday, tuesday, wedensday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is on my inbox list today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add go fishing today to the inbox list\"\n* Mycroft: \"go fishing today was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is due today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 1 task on it, that are due today, go fishing\"\n\n#### Find task on list\nFind a task on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find milk on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found milk on list grocery\"\n\n#### Read list\nRead the tasks on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n#### Undo\nIf an operation makes changes to your lists or tasks, it can be undone within 2 minutes, for example:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add call home to list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"call home was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, undo\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have removed call home from list inbox again\"\n\nThe words \"undo\", \"revert\", \"roll back\" and \"restore\" can be used\n\n#### Report an error\nIn case of a technical error, the cows lists will ask you if you want a mail with the details. Answer yes, and you will receive a mail from Mycroft with further details on how to report the issue, and all the details about the error.\nYou receive the mail, it is not sent the skill developer. The mail contains detalis about how to report the error to the skill developer,\nand you decide what information to put in the issue report.\n\nOther issues that are not caught as describe above, can be reported as well, on https://github.com/CarstenAgerskov/skill-the-cows-lists/issues.",
