Instructions below.**  To use this skill currently you will need to create your own application using [The Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) due to Spotify policy (see *Spotify Authentication reason* for some details). Detailed instructions are available below under *Personal Access Token*.  Listen to music from your Spotify Premium music account",
        "description": "Stream your favorite music from the popular Spotify music service. Spotify\nPremium users can search and play tracks from their own playlists or the huge\nSpotify music library.\n\nYou can also control your Mycroft device using the Spotify Connect system.\nSo play DJ on your phone while listening on Mycroft!\n\n### This skill doesn't do any playback\nThis skill works with the Spotify Connect protocol to interact with Spotify devices, but doesn't perform any playback itself. If you want playback on the hosting Mycroft device, you'll need to set up a player yourself.\n\nFor Picroft users, [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) is a good choice.\n\nInstall it and then make changes to `/etc/default/raspotify.conf` as follows\n\n- It is recommended to set the DEVICE_NAME to the name of the Mycroft unit (as registered at home.mycroft.ai) for automatic identification:\n\n`DEVICE_NAME=\"<My Mycroft Unit>\"\n\n- set your Spotify username and password under `OPTIONS`\n\n`OPTIONS=\"--username <My Username> --password <My Password>\"`\n\n\nYou make sound work with raspotify you may need to edit `/lib/systemd/system/raspotify.service` and there change `User` and `Group` from `raspotify`to `pi`.\n\n\nFor desktop users the official spotify player works well.\n\nThe exception to this is the Mark-1 which is shipped with a spotify player library.\n\n### Authorization:\nThis Skill uses two different methods of authentication. Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### Personal Access Token\n\n##### Creating access token\nFrom the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)\n\n1. Click \"CREATE AN APP\"\n1. Fill out the create application form\n1. Click on the new app and choose EDIT SETTINGS\n1. Under Redirect URIs add `https://localhost:8888`\n\nMore info can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/).\n\nThe config will by default be stored in the `XDG_CONFIG` directory, which is often `~/.configi`, so by default the generated files are found in `~/.config/spotipy/`. If you wish to use another directory you can set the environment variable `SPOTIFY_SKILL_CREDS_DIR` to the directory where you'd like to store the config. This is useful when running in docker for example.\n\n##### Connecting spotify skill\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, from the mycroft-core folder run the auth.py script in the mycroft-spotify folder\n\n```\nsource venv-activate.sh\npython /opt/mycroft/skills/mycroft-spotify.forslund/auth.py\n```\n\nThe script will try to guide you through connecting a developer account to the skill and store the credentials locally.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spotify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",

        "description": "Get listings of US National Parks by state, have Mycroft read descriptions of  national parks and even test your knowledge of where National Parks are located.\n\nTo use this skill  you will need to obtain an API key from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).  Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n\nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",
