Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### API connection to your Spotify account\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, in your [Skill\nsettings for Spotify](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill) in home.mycroft.ai you will see settings for the Spotify Skill. You will see a username and password field and a 'Connect' button. Ignore the username and password field for now, and click the 'Connect' button. You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",

Use Mycroft to easily interact with nearby lights and light groups you create within the Wink ecosystem.\n\nYour can easily find the right light or lights based on the names of lights and groups.  The Mycroft device's Name (set at [Home](https://home.mycroft.ai/ -- check by asking \"what is your name?\")\ncan be used to find lights and/or groups with begin with that same name. For example, if your Mycroft device's location is set to 'Kitchen' and you say \"Turn on the light\", lights with the following names would be turned on:\n\n* Kitchen\n* Kitchen sink\n* Kitchen fan (group consisting of 'Fan 1', 'Fan 2', 'Fan 3')\nIt will NOT turn on a light called \"Porch off the kitchen\".\n\nYou can also include the light/group name in your request, along with intensity words, such as: `bright`, `dim`, `full`, `half`, `completely`, `partially`",
