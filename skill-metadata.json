Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n\nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",

You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",
