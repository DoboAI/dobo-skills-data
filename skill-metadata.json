Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### API connection to your Spotify account\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, in your [Skill\nsettings for Spotify](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill) in home.mycroft.ai you will see settings for the Spotify Skill. You will see a username and password field and a 'Connect' button. Ignore the username and password field for now, and click the 'Connect' button. You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",

        "description": "Mycroft will announce estimated arrival times of MBTA buses at your stop so you never leave the house before you have to.  All data and arrival predictions used by this skill are provided by the MBTA.\n\nSee below for full documentation, including how to track buses traveling toward your stop, but to get started just say \"Hey Mycroft, T Bus Arrivals\".  You will be prompted for the bus route, direction and stop name.  Mycroft will respond with all estimated arrival times at your stop.\n\n<details><summary>View Sample dialog</summary>\n<dl>\n<dt>Hey Mycroft T Bus Arrivals</dt>\n<dd>Which route are you riding?</dd>\n<dt>One</dt>\n<dd>Are you going outbound toward Harvard or Inbound toward Dudley?</dd>\n<dt>Inbound</dt>\n<dd>Which stop?</dd>\n<dt>Mount Auburn Street at Putnam Ave</dt>\n<dd>Route One service to Dudley arrivals for Mount Auburn Street at Putnam Avenue:<dd>\n<dd>Arriving in 11 minutes<dd>\n<dd>Arriving in 21 minutes<dd>\n<dd>Arriving in 34 minutes<dd>\n</dl>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>View Full Documentation</summary>\n\n#### T bus or Transit\n\nWherever this documentation calls for saying \"T bus\" to Mycroft it can be replaced with \"transit\", and vice versa.  If Mycroft is having difficulty understanding  one, try the other.\n\n#### Arrival Times\n\nTo provide bus arrival times the skill requires three pieces of information:  bus route, traveling direction and bus stop.  If you do not provide all information needed the skill will prompt you for the rest.  For example, saying\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57 going inbound stop Brighton Ave and Linden Street\n\nwill retrieve all arrival times predicted for the stop.  The arrival times could also be retrieved by any of the following:\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57 going inbound\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57\n\n> T bus arrivals\n\nMycroft will prompt for any missing information.\n\n#### Bus Tracking\n\nBus tracking is similar to Arrival Times but Mycroft will continue to track buses, periodically updating their predicted arrival times, until they have passed the stop.  By default Mycroft will track the next three buses and will announce updated arrival predictions every 30 seconds.  These values can be changed in the skill settings on Mycroft Home.  The minimum frequency of updates  is 30 seconds.\n\nAs with Arrivals, say\n\n> T bus tracking\n\nto begin.  Predicted arrival times of the next three tracked buses will be announced right away and updated every 30 seconds.  Be aware that there may be any number of buses heading to your stop but only the arrival predictions for the tracked buses will be announced.\n\nWhen a bus passes your stop it will drop off the tracking list and there will be one fewer arrival time announced on subsequent updates.  When all buses have passed your stop Mycroft will automatically stop tracking.  If you would like tracking to end at any time say\n\n> T bus shutdown\n\n#### Shortcuts\n\nIf you ride the same route from the same stop often you will want to use shortcuts.  After Mycroft announces arrivals or starts tracking buses you may save the route, direction and stop combination as a shortcut using any name you wish.\n\nSuppose you take the bus to work and went through the process of asking for arrivals, telling Mycroft the bus route, direction and stop.  Now say\n\n> transit save shortcut\n\nand Mycroft will prompt you for a name.  If you say\n\n> rat race\n\nyou may get Arrivals or begin Bus Tracking using the shortcut\n\n>T bus tracking rat race\n\nTwo additional phrases\n\n> list T bus shortcuts\n\n> T bus remove shortcut rat race\n\nallow you to list and delete saved shortcuts.\n\n#### API Key\n\nWhen installed this skill does not use an API key when getting data from the MBTA servers.  Using a key allows a higher rate limit when requesting data.  It should not be necessary to use an API key but if you like you may obtain one on the [MBTA website](https://api-v3.mbta.com/register). In the skill settings on Mycroft Home check the box next to \"Use my API key\" and enter your key in the text field.\n\n</details>",

        "description": "Get listings of US National Parks by state, have Mycroft read descriptions of  national parks and even test your knowledge of where National Parks are located.\n\nTo use this skill  you will need to obtain an API key from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).  Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n\nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",
